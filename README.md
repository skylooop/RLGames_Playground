# Aplying RL in different Games (WIP). 
Currently ViZdoom and FlappyBird is in progress.
Applying RL for playing different games. Idea is to also implement imitation learning algorithms


## FlappyBird 
Source code for running FlappyBird `https://github.com/sourabhv/FlapPyBird`. In this repo, I modify the source code to make it usable in typical RL settings (i.e to operate 'nicely' with OpenAI Gym framework)


##ViZDoom

## Unity3D
